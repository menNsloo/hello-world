# hello-world
Starting off to learn how this works
I am a bachelors student interested in web development and machine learning and looking forward to create and upload projects on github.

Talking about webdev, I am currently still learning front-end side technologies like javascript(DOM), jquery,Bootstrap 

Machine learning fascinates me to build new cool stuffs under natural language processing and computer vision.
This is it. Btw I am trying to figure out how exactly github and its components work and looking forward to contribute to open source projects
